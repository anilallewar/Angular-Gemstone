# Angular-Gemstone
This is sample application that demonstrates basics of building application using Angular.js; it follows the tutorial at [Angular tutorial - Code Schoold](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/intro)

## Pre-requisites
1. Node.js (version >= 0.12.6)
2. npm (version >= 2.11.2)

## Build application
1. Navigate to the root folder and run `npm install` to download all node module dependencies.
2. Now run `bower install` to download all application dependencies.
3. If you see errors saying `-bash: grunt: command not found`; then re-install grunt CLI using the command `npm install -g grunt-cli`.

## Run application
Once the application is built, run `grunt serve`. This would start the server and open the default browser pointing to the root of the SPA. You can browse the application then from this starting point.
